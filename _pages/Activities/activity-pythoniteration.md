  goals: 
    - To be able to explain the uses of the <code>while</code> loop structure 
    - To be able to apply boolean expressions to iterative structures via the <code>while</code> loop    
    - To be able to explain the uses of the <code>for</code> loop structure 
    - To be able to apply boolean expressions to iterative structures via the <code>for</code> loop

        Conditionals can be used to repeatedly execute code.  There are two varieties of these &quot;loops:&quot; the for loop (which is useful when counting the number of iterations that are needed), and the while loop (which is useful for executing until something is true).

        import random
        
        def checkIfRaining():
            return True
        
        raining = False;

        while not raining:
            randVal = random.random() # 0 to 1
            minutes = round(randVal * 20) # whole numbers 0 to 20

        ]]></script>        
      title: The <code>while</code> Loop
      questions:
        - Modify this code to implement a <code>checkIfRaining()</code> function that generates a random number between 1 and 10, and returns <code>true</code> if the number is greater than 7 (and return <code>false</code> otherwise).
        - "Modify this program to ensure that the number of minutes is never 0 (make it at least 1)."
        - "Write a program to ask the user for their age, but keep asking until they enter a positive number."

            i += 1
        ]]></script>    
      title: The <code>for</code> Loop
      questions:
        - The code prints the numbers from 0 through 9.  Why doesn’t it also print the value 10?
        - What could you do to change this to print the values 0 through 10?  
        - What could you do to print the values 1 through 10?

      title: Nested Loops
      questions:
        - How many times does the inner loop print statement execute?
        - How many times does the outer loop print statement execute?
        - How many times does the first print statement execute, and why?

            print(heads)
        ]]></script>     
      title: Flipping a Coin
      questions:
        - "What does <code>range(10)</code> do?  Try printing <code>range(10)</code> to the screen; how does it work?"
        - "Rewrite this program to use a <code>for</code> loop instead."
        - "Modify this program to only print the number of heads once after the loop has finished."
        - How many times would you expect to land on heads?
        - What would you change to flip the coin 100 times?  How many heads would you expect then?
        - What would be the effect of changing the constant in the program from 0.5 to 0.3?

      title: Iterating over Text Characters
      questions:
        - "What does this program do?"
        - "Modify this program to count the number of vowels in the string, and print out the result."
