      title: "Data Maps"
      questions:
        - "Consider the dictionary and phone book above.  When you look something up in each of them, what are you looking up, and what are you looking <strong>for</strong>?  What are the data types?"
        - What are some ways that we make these lookups easier?  How are the data organized, and what part of the data is organized that way?  
        - A phone book maps ______ to ______, and a dictionary maps ______ to ______.
        - In computing, we tend to say that we map keys to values.  For the phone book and dictionary, what is the key, and what is the value?

            print("{} is taught by: {}".format(key, value))
        ]]></script>  
      questions: 
        - What would you change in the program above to store the number of students enrolled in each course, instead of the instructor of each course?
        - "Suppose you are developing a web browser that accesses web pages.  You want to <strong>cache</strong> the pages, so that you only access them once, to save on I/O, network calls, and your data plan.  How might a <code>HashMap</code> help you to do this?  What would be the key and the value?"

        - "Write a program to print the instructor, the enrollment, and all the students in all classes."
