excerpt: "CS170: Programming for the World Around Us - Conditionals in Python"

info:
  goals: 
    - To be able to write an <code>if</code> statement
    - To be able to write an <code>else</code> statement
    - To design boolean expressions for conditionals
    - To combine the <code>if</code> and <code>else</code> blocks to form conditionals that utilize the <code>else if</code> construct
    - To implement complex conditional statements using boolean expression operators
  models:
    - model: |
        <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: python"><![CDATA[
        age = 38
        
        if age >= 35:
            print("You are old enough to run for President of the United States!")
        ]]></script>     
      title: Conditionals for Selective Execution with <code>if</code> Statements
      questions:
        - Try running the above program for different ages (say, 18, 34, 35, and 36).

        <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: python"><![CDATA[
        age = 38

            print("You are old enough to run for President of the United States!")

      title: Conditionals for Selective Execution with <code>if</code>/<code>else</code> Statements        
      questions:
        - Write and execute an <code>if</code>/<code>else</code> statement that determines if it is warm and not raining outside, and prints out whether or not it is appropriate to go outside.

      title: Creating a Waterfall of Possibilities by combining <code>else</code> and <code>if</code>
      questions:
        - Which code structure above do you prefer and why?
        - "Can you switch the order of the <code>if</code> statements in either example?  Why or why not?"
    - model: |
        <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: python"><![CDATA[
        age = 25
        
        if age >= 18 and age < 35: { # Why < 35 and not <= 35?
            print("???") # What should we say here?
        ]]></script>      
      title: "Compound <code>if</code> conditionals"
      questions: 
        - What text should go into the <code>println</code> statement to indicate whether the person can vote (at least age 18) but also is too young to run for president (at least age 35)?
        - "Can you switch the order of the checks inside the <code>if</code> statement?  Why or why not?"
        - "Consider the letter grade breakdown table on our <a href=\"../#grading\">course syllabus</a>.  Write a series of compound <code>if</code> statements that determines if your grade is an A+, an A, or an A-."

      title: "Putting It All Together: Implementing a Venn Diagram"
      questions:
        - "Make up a 3-way <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venn_diagram\">Venn Diagram</a> of your choosing; you can look one up on the Internet if you wish."
        - "Label the three large circles \"A\", \"B\", and \"C\".  In each of the 7 regions within the Venn Diagram, which elements are true and which are false?"
        - "Write a series of <code>if</code> statements that may use <code>else</code> and <code>else if</code> blocks that print out the different states of your Venn Diagram.  There are a few ways to go about this, so we will discuss and compare approaches as a class."

      title: "Using Flow Charts to Observe Conditional Program Flow"
      questions:
        - "Draw a flowchart diagram that illustrates the control flow of your Venn Diagram program."
        - "Draw a flowchart of a conditional that checks if your grade is within range for each letter grade in the class."
