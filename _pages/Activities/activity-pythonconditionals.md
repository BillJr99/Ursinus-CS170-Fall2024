title: "CS170: Programming for the World Around Us - Conditionals in Python"


info:
  goals: 
    - To be able to write an <code>if</code> statement
    - To be able to write an <code>else</code> statement
    - To design boolean expressions for conditionals
    - To combine the <code>if</code> and <code>else</code> blocks to form conditionals that utilize the <code>else if</code> construct
    - To implement complex conditional statements using boolean expression operators
  models:

      title: Conditionals for Selective Execution with <code>if</code> Statements
      questions:
        - Try running the above program for different ages (say, 18, 34, 35, and 36).
        - "What is the purpose of the indented text below the <code>if</code> line?  What would happen if you removed that indentation, or added another print statement below that was not indented?"

      title: Conditionals for Selective Execution with <code>if</code>/<code>else</code> Statements        
      questions:
        - Write and execute an <code>if</code>/<code>else</code> statement that determines if it is warm and not raining outside, and prints out whether or not it is appropriate to go outside.

      title: Creating a Waterfall of Possibilities by combining <code>else</code> and <code>if</code>
      questions:
        - Which code structure above do you prefer and why?
        - "What does it mean to put an <code>if</code> statement inside of the body of another <code>if</code> statement?  Give a scenario in which each line of code will execute, and a scenario in which it will not."
        - "Can you switch the order of the <code>if</code> statements in either example?  Why or why not?"

        <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: python"><![CDATA[
        age = 25
        
        if age >= 18 and age < 35: # Why < 35 and not <= 35?
            print("???") # What should we say here?
        ]]></script>      
      title: "Compound <code>if</code> conditionals"
      questions: 
        - What text should go into the <code>print</code> statement to indicate whether the person can vote (at least age 18) but also is too young to run for president (at least age 35)?
        - "Can you switch the order of the checks inside the <code>if</code> statement?  Why or why not?"
        - "Consider the letter grade breakdown table on our <a href=\"../#grading\">course syllabus</a>.  Write a series of compound <code>if</code> statements that determines if your grade is an A+, an A, or an A-."

        <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: python"><![CDATA[
        print("You are in a forest. You see two paths.")
        choice = input("Do you go left or right? ")

        if choice == "left":
            print("You encounter a friendly squirrel.")
        elif choice == "right":
            print("You find a treasure chest!")
        else:
            print("You stand still, unsure of what to do.")
        ]]></script>           
      title: "Try It Out!"
      questions:
        - "What does the <code>==</code> operator do?  Why do you think it is different from a single <code>=</code> sign?"
        - "With a partner, write a short program that either tells an interactive story or treasure hunt, asks a user to guess a secret number (and tells them if they are correct), plays rock-paper-scizzors, plays a question and answer quiz game, or tells you whether you should turn on the heater or air conditioner.  Be prepared to share this with the class!"

      title: "Using Flow Charts to Observe Conditional Program Flow"
      questions:
        - "Draw a flowchart diagram that illustrates the control flow of your Venn Diagram program."
        - "Draw a flowchart of a conditional that checks if your grade is within range for each letter grade in the class."

      questions:
        - "Make up a 3-way <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venn_diagram\">Venn Diagram</a> of your choosing; you can look one up on the Internet if you wish."
        - "Label the three large circles \"A\", \"B\", and \"C\".  In each of the 7 regions within the Venn Diagram, which elements are true and which are false?"
        - "Write a series of <code>if</code> statements that may use <code>else</code> and <code>else if</code> blocks that print out the different states of your Venn Diagram.  There are a few ways to go about this, so we will discuss and compare approaches as a class."
