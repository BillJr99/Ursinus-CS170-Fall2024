      questions: 
        - Pick three numbers from 1 to 10 at random, and write them on the board.
        - What do you notice about the distribution of those numbers?
        - How did you come up with those numbers?  How did you ensure they were truly quot;random?&quot;
        - What does it mean to be &quot;random?&quot;

      questions: 
        - How do computers pick numbers &quot;at random?&quot;
        - How do they decide when to spawn certain &quot;random&quot; events?
        - Is this video game player really good at the game?

      questions: 
        - "The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator\">Linear Congruential Generator</a> is one way to generate a pseudo-random number computationally.  Choose a starting value and generate 3 random numbers using this formula."
        - What would happen if two people used the same starting value (called a &quot;seed&quot;)?
        - How might video games generate a seed?

        micro:bit devices are &quot;programmable units&quot; that have:

        <li>buttons</li>
        </ul>
        </div>
      questions: 
        - "Using the micro:bit, create variables for a, b, c, and X: call them <code>multiplier</code>, <code>adder</code>, <code>modulus</code>, and <code>current</code>."
        - Give them any values you want by setting their values in <code>on start</code>.
        - When the user presses the A button, set the value of the X variable (<code>current</code>) using the formula, and show X on the screen.
        - Is it ok that the X variable appears on the left and the right side of the equals sign?  Why or why not?
        - On start, show the value of X on the screen.
        - When you're done, click on the Python tab at the top.  What do you notice about each block from the original program?
        - Save your project to a GitHub account; you can create one for free!

### Pairing the Microbit to your Computer

You can connect the micro:bit to your computer by plugging in the USB cable.  However, some computers do not have a compatible mac cable.  If you don't have an adapter, your computer may support Bluetooth, a wireless protocol that you can use to connect to the micro:bit.  You can do this by holding down the A and B buttons of the micro:bit, and, while holding them down, press and release the reset button.  You'll see the words "PAIRING MODE" appear on the micro:bit display.  Open a bluetooth application on your computer (on the Mac, one such program is called LightBlue), and select the BBC micro:bit to pair.  The micro:bit will prompt you to press the A button and a 6-digit code will appear on the screen.  Type that code on your mac and you should have access to the storage of the micro:bit!  You can download your code from Makecode, and then drag the `.hex` file from your Downloads directory to the micro:bit disk.  It will restart and launch your app automatically.  Here is a video describing the process on a Mac, although the process is similar on other Bluetooth enabled computers.
